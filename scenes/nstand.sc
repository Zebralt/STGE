[Content]
The dusty nightstand is covered in wax from the melted candles. The wax is solid and cold, as if the candles burned a while ago, yet there is still smoke coming out. You find a drawer in the nightstand and open it. It is worn out and won't open. Finally, after much struggle, you pry it open. You are met with more dust and what seems to be a pair of scissors, though you can't quite tell the use of the item.
